Word Game Psuedo Code. 

Here's how the app works:

<!-- WE DOING SMASH BROS BABY! -->
<!-- FOUR CHARACTERS - MARIO KIRBY LINK FOX CAPTAIN FALCON MARTH PIKACHU JIGGLYPUFF OLIMAR MEWTWO VILLAGER SAMUS DK BOWSER -->

When the game starts, the player will choose a character by clicking on the fighter's picture. The player will fight as that character for the rest of the game.
<!-- Start game off with 4 buttons with different character pictures, we then want to move that picture/button into the "fighting area" -->
<!-- All "four" of the characters have fixed health values(all variables) -->


The player must then defeat all of the remaining fighters. Enemies should be moved to a different area of the screen.

The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture.

Once the player selects an opponent, that enemy is moved to a defender area.
<!-- We want to start of by using a click function to chose one and the picture will move to the top, then the second click function chooses an enemy -->
<!-- After the click we want To move under the "fight" button -->
The player will now be able to click the attack button.
<!-- we need a third button to start the action of maths -->

Whenever the player clicks attack, their character damages the defender. The opponent will lose HP (health points). These points are displayed at the bottom of the 
defender's picture. The opponent character will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, the player's character will lose some of their HP. These points are 
shown at the bottom of the player character's picture. The player will keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their opponent.
<!-- When the math button is hit, it create texts that thas say the actions. "______ attack does _____ damage. Defender's name attack hits back for _____ damage." -->
<!-- After maths happen the heath bars go down -->
<!-- After the attack, the user attacks gets an addition of the attack -->
<!-- We repeat this until one of the characters health is gone. Keep in mind that the user's fighter's damage goes first,  -->

When the defender's HP is reduced to zero or below, remove the enemy from the defender area. The player character can now choose a new opponent.
The player wins the game by defeating all enemy characters. The player loses the game the game if their character's HP falls to zero or below.
<!-- Need a function(maybe a life variable that goes from 1 to 0 when the character "dies", so it runs a function to disappear) when either player's health hits 0. -->
<!-- We now need to re-run the click to choose a hero that replaces the "dead" hero OR if the user character dies it restarts the game(reset variable from last game that
    resets the variables) -->
    <!--  -->

Option 2 Game design notes
Each character in the game has 3 attributes: Health Points, Attack Power and Counter Attack Power.

Each time the player attacks, their character's Attack Power increases by its base Attack Power.

For example, if the base Attack Power is 6, each attack will increase the Attack Power by 6 (12, 18, 24, 30 and so on).
The enemy character only has Counter Attack Power.

Unlike the player's Attack Points, Counter Attack Power never changes.
The Health Points, Attack Power and Counter Attack Power of each character must differ.

No characters in the game can heal or recover Health Points.

A winning player must pick their characters wisely by first fighting an enemy with low Counter Attack Power. This will allow them to grind Attack Power and to take on enemies before they lose all of their Health Points. Healing options would mess with this dynamic.
Your players should be able to win and lose the game no matter what character they choose. The challenge should come from picking the right enemies, not choosing the strongest player.**-
